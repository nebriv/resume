        \jobdescription{Led the development of the cybersecurity program at a globally recognized research and educational institution. Established layered defenses with a focus on enhanced visibility and rapid detection, adopting new and well established technologies and methodologies. Prioritized strategic, impactful security measures that both safeguarded and supported the institutionâ€™sprimary focus on research and education. These foundational security initiatives empowered the museum to safely extend its global reach and influence.}
        
        \begin{jobresponsibilities}
            \item Formulate and oversee the institution's cybersecurity strategy, ensuring a balance between security measures and the organization's core focus on research and education.
            \item Continuously assess potential security risks and implement measures to mitigate vulnerabilities across on-premises infrastructure, cloud platforms, and vendor solutions.
            \item Architect and deploy a multi-tiered security approach, incorporating both traditional defenses like network-based IDS and advanced deceptive measures. This strategy aims to enhance detection speed, increase system-wide visibility, and proactively identify potential breaches in their earliest stages.
            \item Lead the institution's response to cybersecurity incidents, coordinating rapid detection, containment, and remediation efforts.
            \item Influence the selection, deployment, and effective use of security technologies and tools in alignment with the institution's objectives.

    network, a high-speed network designed to support the transfer and management of high-
    volume scientific research data. Responsible for the development and implementation of
    low impact highly effective security measures.
            \item Spearheaded the integration of 802.1x EAP-TLS authentication, complemented by the implementation of Single Sign-On (SSO), advanced Identity and Access Management (IAM), and Azure Conditional Access. Further fortified user access controls through the deployment of DuoSecurity's Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and FIDO2 tokens, anchoring the institution's move toward a holistic zero-trust framework.
            \item Optimized and fortified Google Workspace according to best practices.
            \item Authored over 60 internal code repositories in GitLab, comprised of tools for operations, incident investigation, IOC automation, SIEM mailbox monitoring, data redaction, and more. Leveraging CI/CD for risk-reduced deployment of detection and prevention strategies.
            \item Transitioned legacy ASA firewalls to a more agile and robust multi-context high-availability cluster. Additionally, introduced cloud-based firewalls, facilitating the secure migration of essential business processes to cloud infrastructures, offering scalability and adaptability to emerging threats.
            \item Introduced custom advanced hunting rules in Defender for tailored business detections. Designed rules to detect and counter sophisticated phishing campaigns.
            \item Conceptualized and built an internal Security Operations using open-source platforms, enhancing the institution's threat monitoring and incident response capabilities. Incorporated a cloud solution to streamline on-call rotations, triaging, and notifications. This platform's versatility was recognized and expanded to address system operations beyond just cybersecurity needs.
            \item Led the evolution of the institution's centralized logging capabilities by implementing an ELK stack. Directed the integration of diverse log sources, including servers, network hardware, cloud services, and more. Developed unit testing for specific log capture capabilities to valid capabilities across system upgrades and changes. Strategically developed alerts based on data collected from previous penetration tests, bolstering detection and proactive response to potential attack vectors.
            \item Developed a tailored cybersecurity training curriculum, complemented by controlled phishing tests to gauge and enhance employee threat awareness. This initiative led to heightened user vigilance, evidenced by the successful detection and reporting of sophisticated phishing campaigns.

            \setlength\itemsep{3pt}
            \item \textbf{This Resume!} (https://github.com/nebriv/resume/)\\While all resumes are a bit of project, I heeded many a peers advice and built out this resume using LaTeX. I then took it a bit further and developed a little Github action workflow to automatically build a PDF. This allows for multiple different versions of content, and should provide a good history.
            \item \textbf{VTOLVR-Mods} (https://vtolvr-mods.com)\\Developed python backend to allowing mod creators to upload their mod packages to a central location accessible by the mod loader platform. Backend site utilizes a RESTful API, numerous integrations with Steam, Discord and others, as well as full administration and moderation utilizes.
