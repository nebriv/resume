        Most of my work can be found on \href{https://github.com/nebriv/}{my github account https://github.com/nebriv/}, but there are a few projects I wanted to highlight.\\

            \setlength\itemsep{3pt}
            \item \textbf{This Resume!} (https://github.com/nebriv/resume/)\\While all resumes are a bit of project, I heeded many a peers advice and built out this resume using LaTeX. I then took it a bit further and developed a little Github action workflow to automatically build a PDF. This allows for multiple different versions of content, and should provide a good history.
            \item \textbf{VTOLVR-Mods} (https://vtolvr-mods.com)\\Developed python backend to allowing mod creators to upload their mod packages to a central location accessible by the modloader platform. Backend site utilizes a RESTful API, numerous integrations with Steam, Discord and others, as well as full administration and moderation utilizes.
