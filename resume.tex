Additionally, introduced cloud-based firewalls, facilitating the secure migration of essential business processes to cloud infrastructures, offering scalability and adaptability to emerging threats.
            \item Developed an in-house security operations platform using open-source and cloud solutions, bolstering threat monitoring and incident handling. Implemented Defender Advanced Hunting rules tailored for sophisticated phishing campaigns, and other industry specific threats. Integrated detection and response strategies with the Mitre ATT\&CK framework, ensuring comprehensive coverage and minimizing gaps in institutional defenses against adversary tactics.
            \item Led the evolution of the institution's centralized logging capabilities by implementing an ELK stack. Directed the integration of diverse log sources, including servers, network hardware, cloud services, and more. Developed unit testing for specific log capture capabilities to valid capabilities across system upgrades and changes. Strategically developed alerts based on data collected from previous penetration tests, bolstering detection and proactive response to potential attack vectors.
            \item Developed a tailored cybersecurity training curriculum, complemented by controlled phishing tests to gauge and enhance employee threat awareness. This initiative led to heightened user vigilance, evidenced by the successful detection and reporting of sophisticated phishing campaigns.
            \item Transitioned from Spirion to Microsoft's DLP solution to enhance secure management of sensitive data, deployed on premise data scanners. Collaborated with appointed departmental data custodians to review and address findings, streamlining data protection and compliance efforts. Developed sensitive data labels for users to flag their data in accordance with institutional data security policies.
