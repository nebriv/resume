# Latest Resume
You can download/view the latest version of my resume here:

https://github.com/nebriv/resume/releases/latest/download/resume.pdf

# Resume Generation
Uses Github actions to automatically build different versions (based off of branches) of my resume. The intention is to have one "main" version (main branch) that can then be pulled from to create more specific resume versions as the need arises.

# Deployment?
The thought is to hopefully push out the generated PDFs to wherever I have my resume listed. I'll probably just start back linking to the "main" latest version for now though as the former will likely require some API shenandigans that I'm not sure are even possible.

# Sauce
Original resume generated via https://resumake.io. It looks like the template was originally sourced from here: https://github.com/dnl-blkv/mcdowell-cv

I chose this template is it most closely resembled my current resume. Perhaps in the future I'll dress it up a bit or get ambitious and craft my own template.
